                  <p><strong>&ldquo;Personal Data&rdquo;</strong> refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person that NEAR AI Processes on behalf of Customer under these Terms. For purposes of this DPA, the term &ldquo;Personal Data&rdquo; includes &ldquo;personal information,&rdquo; &ldquo;personally identifiable information,&rdquo; and similar terms defined under Data Protection Laws, but does not include Business Contact Information or Usage Data, as such terms are defined in these Terms.</p>
                  <p><strong>&ldquo;Process&rdquo;</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;Processing&rdquo;</strong> mean any operation or set of operations performed on Personal Data or on sets of Personal Data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, creating, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.</p>

The details provided in Schedule A are deemed to satisfy any requirement to provide such details under any Data Protection Law.</p>
                  <p>NEAR AI will Process Personal Data solely: (1) to fulfill its obligations to Customer under these Terms, including this DPA; (2) on Customer&apos;s behalf; and (3) in compliance with Data Protection Laws. NEAR AI will not &ldquo;sell&rdquo; Personal Data (as such term in quotation marks is defined in applicable Data Protection Laws), &ldquo;share&rdquo; or Process Personal Data for purposes of &ldquo;cross-context behavioral advertising&rdquo; or &ldquo;targeted advertising&rdquo; (as such terms in quotation marks are defined in applicable Data Protection Laws), or otherwise Process Personal Data for any purpose other than for the specific purposes set forth herein or outside of the direct business relationship with Customer. For the avoidance of doubt, NEAR AI will Process Personal Data solely to provide the cloud processing services to Customer as set forth in these Terms, or as otherwise permitted by Data Protection Laws (for example, to comply with NEAR AI&apos;s legal obligations). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this DPA, NEAR AI may process Personal Data as an independent Controller for its own legitimate business operations, including security, fraud prevention, compliance, internal reporting, and product development and improvement, in each case as described in NEAR AI&apos;s Privacy Policy.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Module 2 of the EU SCCs applies to transfers of Personal Data from Customer (as a controller) to NEAR AI (as a processor), or to the extent that NEAR AI acts as a controller with respect to Personal Data from Customer, in accordance with Section 2(2) of the DPA, then Module 1 of the EU SCCs applies and the Parties act as independent controllers;</li>
                    <li>Clause 7 (the optional docking clause) is included;</li>
                    <li>Under Clause 9 (Use of subprocessors), the Parties select Option 2 (General written authorization).

                    <li>Under Clause 11 (Redress), the optional language requiring that Data Subjects be permitted to lodge a complaint with an independent dispute resolution body shall not be deemed to be included;</li>
                    <li>Under Clause 17 (Governing law), the Parties choose Option 1 (the law of an EU Member State that allows for third-Party beneficiary rights). The Parties select the laws of Ireland;</li>
                    <li>Under Clause 18 (Choice of forum and jurisdiction), the Parties select the courts of Ireland;</li>
                    <li>Annex I(A) and I(B) (List of Parties) is completed as set forth in Schedule A of this DPA;</li>
                    <li>Under Annex I(C) (Competent supervisory authority), the Parties shall follow the rules for identifying such authority under Clause 13 and, to the extent legally permissible, select the Irish Data Protection Commission.</li>
                    <li>Annex II (Technical and organizational measures) is completed with Schedule A of this DPA; and</li>
                    <li>Annex III (List of subprocessors) is not applicable as the Parties have chosen General Authorization under Clause 9. However, a list of NEAR AI&apos;s subprocessors is available in Schedule B.</li>

Undefined capitalized terms used in this provision shall mean the definitions in the UK SCCs. For purposes of the UK SCCs, they shall be deemed completed as follows: (i) the Parties&apos; details shall be the Parties and their affiliates to the extent any of them is involved in such transfer; (ii) the Key Contacts shall be the contacts set forth in Schedule A; (iii) the Approved EU SCCs referenced in Table 2 shall be the EU SCCs as executed by the Parties; (iv) Annex 1A, 1B, II, and III shall be set forth in Schedules A and B below; (v) either Party may end this DPA as set out in Section 19 of the UK SCCs; and (vi) by entering into this DPA, the Parties are deemed to be signing the UK SCCs.</p>
                  <p>For transfers of Personal Data subject to the FADP, the EU SCCs form part of this DPA as set forth in Section 7(b) of this DPA, but with the following differences to the extent required by the FADP: (i) references to the GDPR are to be understood as references to the FADP insofar as the data transfers are subject exclusively to the FADP; (ii) references to personal data also refer to data about identifiable legal entities; (iii) the term &ldquo;member state&rdquo; shall not be interpreted to exclude Data Subjects in Switzerland; and (iv) the relevant supervisory authority is the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.</p>
