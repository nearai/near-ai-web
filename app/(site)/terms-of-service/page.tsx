                    <p>Upon expiration or termination of CVM-based Services, or upon Customer&apos;s written request, NEAR AI will decommission the applicable CVM environments in accordance with its standard decommissioning processes. Where Customer manages the cryptographic keys within the TEE, Customer&apos;s deletion of those keys constitutes Customer&apos;s primary mechanism for rendering associated data irrecoverable. NEAR AI disclaims any and all responsibility for data that remains in encrypted form solely because Customer has not exercised its key destruction capabilities.</p>
                    <p><strong>14.9.1 Dedicated CVMs.</strong> NEAR AI&apos;s decommissioning procedures for Dedicated CVMs are designed to render encrypted CVM memory, storage, and host-level data irrecoverable across the entire allocated physical hardware stack, in accordance with NEAR AI&apos;s documented data destruction standards.

                  <SubSection number="16.2" title="Customer Responsibility for AI Agent Conduct.">
                    <p>Customer is solely and exclusively responsible for all actions taken by any AI Agent deployed under Customer&apos;s Account, regardless of whether such actions were explicitly authorized, foreseeable or intended by Customer. Customer agrees that the foregoing responsibility is not diminished by the autonomous nature of the AI Agent, or the fact that the AI Agent was developed by a third party. Without limiting the foregoing, Customer shall be responsible for:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>16.2.1</strong> all actions taken by sub-agents, delegated processes, or additional agent instances initiated by an AI Agent originally deployed by Customer, which shall be attributed to Customer for all purposes under these Terms;</li>

                      <li><strong>16.2.3</strong> ensuring that each AI Agent is configured with appropriate scope limitations, permission boundaries, and intervention mechanisms prior to deployment; and</li>
                      <li><strong>16.2.4</strong> implementing and maintaining human oversight mechanisms sufficient to monitor AI Agent behavior, detect anomalous or unintended actions, and intervene where necessary, including where such monitoring must be implemented by Customer within its CVM, given NEAR AI&apos;s inability to access AI Agent activity within a TEE.</li>

                    <p>The scope of NEAR AI&apos;s visibility into AI Agent behavior depends on the applicable Deployment Type:</p>
                    <p><strong>16.3.1 AI Agents in Standard VM Environments.</strong> Where Customer deploys AI Agents within a Standard VM environment, Customer acknowledges that: (i) NEAR AI may have visibility into and access to AI Agent behavior, including prompts, Outputs, logs and interactions, for the purposes described in Section 13.3; (ii) NEAR AI may use such access to provide debugging, support, security monitoring and performance optimization; (iii) notwithstanding such access, NEAR AI does not assume, and disclaims all, responsibility for monitoring, controlling or intervening in AI Agent behavior, and Customer remains solely responsible for AI Agent configurations, actions and outcomes; and (iv) NEAR AI does not undertake to review AI Agent outputs or actions for accuracy, legality or compliance, except as required to enforce these Terms or pursuant to applicable law. Customer should not rely on NEAR AI access as a substitute for implementing appropriate safeguards, monitoring and controls over AI Agent behavior.</p>
                    <p><strong>16.3.2 AI Agents in CVM Environments.</strong> This Section 16.3.2 applies only to AI Agents deployed within CVM environments. Where Customer deploys AI Agents within its CVM, Customer acknowledges that the architecture of the TEE is designed such that NEAR AI has limited or no ability to observe, access, audit, log, intervene in, or otherwise monitor AI Agent behavior, decisions, outputs, data processing or credential use within the TEE. Customer acknowledges that this limitation is inherent to the confidential computing architecture described above in Section 14 and is not a deficiency in the NEAR AI Cloud. Customer further and expressly acknowledges that as a direct result of the CVM architecture: (i) NEAR AI cannot detect or prevent unauthorized, anomalous, or harmful AI Agent behavior occurring within a CVM in real time; (ii) NEAR AI cannot recover, reconstruct, or provide access to any AI Agent outputs, decisions, logs, processed data, or other information generated within a CVM, whether for Customer&apos;s benefit, in response to a legal process, or otherwise; and (iii) NEAR AI cannot provide any audit trail, activity log, or compliance record of AI Agent actions occurring within a CVM, and Customer is solely responsible for implementing any logging, monitoring, or audit capability it requires within its own CVM environment. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer&apos;s responsibility for AI Agent conduct is not contingent on any monitoring, oversight or intervention capability that NEAR AI might otherwise provide to Customer in a non-CVM deployment.</p>
                  </SubSection>
                  <SubSection number="16.4" title="Persistent Compute Lifecycle.">
                    <p>AI Agents deployed on the NEAR AI Cloud may operate as persistent compute processes across extended periods. Customer acknowledges and agrees to the following with respect to the lifecycle of such persistent AI Agent deployments:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>16.4.1 No Backup.</strong> NEAR AI does not provide backup services for AI Agent processes or in-enclave AI Agent state. Customer is solely responsible for implementing any state persistence, checkpointing, or recovery mechanisms it requires within its CVM environment. NEAR AI shall have no responsibility for loss of AI Agent state, in-progress task data, or intermediate outputs resulting from suspension, interruption, or termination of Customer&apos;s CVM instance.</li>
                      <li><strong>16.4.2 Suspension.</strong> NEAR AI may suspend a CVM instance hosting an AI Agent in accordance with Section 16.2, or for maintenance, resource management, or operational reasons, upon notice to Customer, if the Customer&apos;s Account supports notification. Customers creating Accounts with NEAR wallets acknowledge and accept that they will not receive notice under this Section or these Terms in general since we do not hold email addresses for Accounts created with a NEAR wallet. Suspension may interrupt AI Agent execution mid-task. Customer acknowledges that suspended Agent instances may not resume from the point of interruption, and that any in-progress Agent tasks, queued actions, or pending external API calls may be abandoned or lost upon suspension. Customer is solely responsible for designing AI Agents to handle such suspension and interruption, including implementing controls designed to prevent unintended duplicate execution of actions, task queuing, and external state management where required.</li>
                      <li><strong>16.4.3 Termination.</strong> Upon termination of Customer&apos;s CVM-based Services, whether by Customer or NEAR AI, all AI Agent processes operating within the CVM will be terminated. Section 14.9 above governs the decommissioning and data destruction obligations applicable to a CVM upon such termination. Customer acknowledges that any AI Agent tasks in progress at the time of termination will not be completed by NEAR AI, and that NEAR AI shall have no responsibility for the consequences of mid-task AI Agent termination, including any third-party effects of uncompleted AI Agent actions.</li>
                      <li><strong>16.4.4 No Recovery of In-TEE State.</strong> Consistent with the architecture design described in Section 14.5 and Section 16.3.2, NEAR AI cannot access, recover, or reconstruct any AI Agent state, memory, task history, or processed data that existed within a TEE at the time of suspension or termination. Customer&apos;s sole mechanism for preserving AI Agent state is to implement state externalization or data persistence mechanisms within its own CVM environment prior to suspension or termination.</li>
                      <li><strong>16.4.5 Backup and Recovery for Non-Confidential Environments.</strong> For AI Agent deployments in Standard VM environments, NEAR AI may maintain encrypted backup copies of AI Agent state, memory, task history, or processed data for recovery purposes. Such backup data is encrypted using Customer-provided keys, and any decryption occurs only within the applicable execution environment, with decrypted data not leaving such environment. Customer may render such backup data permanently inaccessible by destroying the applicable encryption keys.</li>

Monthly subscription Usage Credits expire at the end of the relevant monthly period and do not roll over. Customer may also purchase one-off Usage Credits through the payment methods made available in the product. The applicable price, payment currency, and any conversion rate will be displayed before the purchase is confirmed. One-off Usage Credits do not expire, unless otherwise stated at the time of purchase or required by applicable law. Where one-off Usage Credits are purchased using NEAR, the NEAR used for that purchase is treated as payment for the purchased Usage Credits, not as staked NEAR, and is not available for unstaking or withdrawal. Usage Credits are non-transferable and non-refundable as set out in Sections 10.1 and 10.6. Unless otherwise stated in the product, Usage Credits are consumed in the order in which they expire, such that expiring monthly Usage Credits are consumed before one-off Usage Credits that do not expire.</p>

For Non-Staking Subscriptions, a downgrade may be blocked while Customer remains over quota. For Staking Subscriptions, the downgrade may take effect at the end of the then-current subscription period, and over-quota AI Agents may be stopped, suspended, or deleted after any applicable notice or grace period described in Appendix A or the product. Where Customer uses a NEAR wallet-based Account or has not provided contact details, NEAR AI may be unable to provide off-platform notice, as described in Section 16.4.2. Customer is responsible for managing its AI Agents before any downgrade or reduction takes effect. NEAR AI is not responsible for AI Agent state, in-progress tasks, data loss, third-party effects, or other consequences arising from the stopping, suspension, or deletion of over-quota AI Agents.</p>

While monthly Usage Credits are exhausted, NEAR AI will not terminate Customer&apos;s AI Agents solely because those Usage Credits have been exhausted, and will continue to host those AI Agents and preserve their state in accordance with the applicable product functionality and these Terms. Customer&apos;s AI Agents may continue to run using an alternative inference provider where Customer has configured one. Usage Credits reset at the start of each applicable monthly period, and Customer may also restore NEAR AI inference by purchasing one-off Usage Credits.

                    <p>This Appendix B applies where Customer stakes NEAR to accrue Usage Credits for eligible NEAR AI Cloud services designated by NEAR AI in the product or Documentation, including private inference and related cloud services (&ldquo;Eligible NEAR AI Cloud Services&rdquo;). In the event of a conflict between this Appendix B and the main body of these Terms with respect to staking under this Appendix B, this Appendix B controls.

                    <p>Staking under this Appendix B is Non-Custodial. Customer at all times retains exclusive ownership and control of its Staked NEAR and of the private keys to its Wallet Address. NEAR AI does not take custody or control of Customer&apos;s Staked NEAR or private keys, has no ability under the applicable staking pool contract as deployed to withdraw or transfer Customer&apos;s Staked NEAR, and cannot access or recover Customer&apos;s private keys. Suspension or termination of Customer&apos;s access to the Services does not affect Customer&apos;s ability to unstake and withdraw its Staked NEAR through the NEAR protocol, subject to the Unlock Period. Customer is solely responsible for the security, backup, and management of its Wallet Address and private keys. Customer acknowledges and agrees that: (a) if Customer loses access to its private keys or Wallet Address, NEAR AI cannot restore access to, or recover, Customer&apos;s Staked NEAR; (b) Staked NEAR that becomes inaccessible or abandoned as a result of lost keys is not recoverable by NEAR AI and remains subject to the NEAR protocol; (c) NEAR AI has no responsibility or liability for any loss of Staked NEAR, Staking Rewards, or access to the Services arising from Customer&apos;s loss, compromise, or mismanagement of its keys or Wallet Address; and (d) Staked NEAR remains subject to the NEAR protocol at all times, and NEAR AI has no responsibility or liability for any reduction or loss of Staked NEAR or Staking Rewards arising from protocol-level events (including slashing, penalties, forks, halts, or changes to protocol parameters) or the performance of any validator or staking pool, except to the extent caused by NEAR AI&apos;s fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.</p>

                    <p>Staking Rewards generated in respect of Customer&apos;s Staked NEAR are routed, protocol-direct, to NEAR AI as consideration for Eligible NEAR AI Cloud Services. Customer authorizes such routing as a condition of staking under this Appendix B. Staking Rewards are not paid, credited, distributed, or otherwise made available to Customer as interest, yield, income, or an investment return. Customer has no right, title, or interest in or to Staking Rewards, which accrue to NEAR AI at the protocol level.</p>

                    <p>Customer may stake NEAR through the Validator to accrue Usage Credits for Eligible NEAR AI Cloud Services over time. Usage Credits accrued under this Appendix B are Usage Credits for all purposes under these Terms and do not constitute a separate digital asset, token, stored-value balance, or other property right. The applicable accrual rate, any applicable crediting cadence, and any usage parameters for Eligible NEAR AI Cloud Services will be displayed in the product or Documentation and may be updated by NEAR AI on a prospective basis in accordance with Section 22. Usage Credits may accrue continuously or near-continuously and may be reflected in the product on a delayed or periodic basis.</p>

                    <p>Where NEAR AI Cloud is organization-scoped, Usage Credits purchased under Section 10.1, accrued under this Appendix B, or granted by NEAR AI may be associated with the applicable organization designated in the product rather than an individual user, and may be shared across the members, workspaces, and API keys of that organization as made available by NEAR AI Cloud. The person initiating a stake, stake adjustment, or unstaking request represents that it is authorized to do so for the applicable organization. NEAR AI may display purchased, accrued, granted, used, and remaining balances separately or as a unified spendable total, and may permit such balances to be consumed on an aggregate basis without any required depletion order. Unless otherwise stated in the product or required by applicable law or a compliance restriction under these Terms, Usage Credits accrued under this Appendix B do not expire.</p>
                  </SubSection>

                    <p>Customer may increase, reduce, or initiate unstaking of Staked NEAR under this Appendix B at any time through the Validator or applicable product workflow. Changes to the amount of Staked NEAR affect future accrual only. Usage Credits already accrued under this Appendix B remain available for use in accordance with these Terms. Accrual stops when the unstaking or stake reduction becomes effective in the applicable staking workflow. Staked NEAR becomes withdrawable only after the applicable Unlock Period and any required protocol or validator process have elapsed or been completed.</p>
